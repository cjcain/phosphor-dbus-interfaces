          Minimum supported soft user PowerCap setting.
          The min soft user PowerCap value is normally less than or equal to
          the MinPowerCapValue. When the PowerCap is set to any value between
          MinSoftPowerCapValue and MinPowerCapValue an attempt will be made to
          maintain the cap but it will not be guaranted.
